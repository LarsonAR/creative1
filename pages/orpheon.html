            <h2>A Planet of Community</h2>
            <p>A small planet that houses a small population, Orpheon's unique culture has nonetheless made a
                surprising impact on interstellar society.</p>
            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>Orpheon is an uninviting place to most. A combination of a toxic atmosphere and fierce winds ensure
                most of the surface is barren of life, and while there is fossil evidence of an ancient, lush
                ecosystem thriving in the planet's underground caverns, increased volcanic activity in the past few
                million years appears to have wiped it out. Now, life is gathered in valleys and canyons protected
                from the worst of the harsh environment. It is in these valleys where the Orph have built their
                civilizations.</p>
            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Unusually for modern cultures, Orph society is held together by a shared religion. The religion has
                no name among the Orph because it is considered an intrinsic fact of life. The Orph religion
                teaches that the universe was once a single consciousness that was divided first into stars, then
                into people. The Orph believe that this consciousness will one day come back together, this time
                made complete by the experiences of individuals. Orph value selflessness and community, since they
                view a community as, in a sense, its own consciousness in and of itself.</p>
            <h3>Politics</h3>
            <p>Although it is very rare for an Orph to take up a formal role in politics, Orph culture has
                nonetheless affected interstellar politics dramatically. Because Orph take such an active role in
                helping their communities, they are well-known for standing up for social justice by unofficial
                means. This can dramatically change the culture of a community, especially on asteroid colonies
                where there is no central authority to enforce a social hierarchy.</p>

                    <p>Orpheon is home to only one sapient species: the Orph. These insectoid individuals are 4 to 5
                        feet tall and quite thin. They are not very physically strong, but they can handle extreme
                        environmental conditions. Orph have been known to survive the most extreme cold and heat of
                        Terra, the radiation of Venoa, the dangerously toxic atmosphere of their own planet, and
                        even the vacuum of space (for a short period of time, at least). Although lone Orph are a
                        rare sight in the galaxy, asteroid colonies that house Orph communities are fairly common.</p>

                <div class="tab-pane" id="menu2">
                    <p>Occasionally, Orph are born albino. Although these albino Orph (or "Prime Orph" as they are
                        sometimes known) are not a separate species, they have a significantly different role in Orph
                        society. They are considered spiritual leaders with inherent spiritual gifts. Prime Orph are
                        always sent to be raised by other Prime Orph and only return to their communities of birth
                        after they have been taught the complexities of Orph spirituality. Prime Orph may
                        occasionally leave Orpheon to visit with off-world Orph communities, but they almost never
                        live off-world permanently.</p>
