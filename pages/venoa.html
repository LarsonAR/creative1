            <h2>A Planet in Ruin</h2>
            <p>Once a beautiful planet housing a thriving civilization, a devastating interstellar war has rendered
                the home planet of the Venoans uninhabitable.</p>
            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>Before the Venoan War, Venoa was a cold but lush planet marked by deep ravines and tall plateaus.
                Venoans' wings allowed them to traverse these landscapes with relative ease, and eventually, a
                revolutionary transportation structure made the planet's cities accessible to nearly everyone.
                Venoa had relatively little diversity in its planetary ecosystem; little temperature variation
                between location and seasons made for a single, vast biome. Now that Venoa has been destroyed by
                nuclear weapons, however, it has become almost entirely inhospitable. Most of the planet is
                irradiated to dangerous levels, and safe natural resources are few and far between. Nowadays, its
                only inhabitants are research groups and a handful of small Venoan or Orph communities.</p>
            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Historically, Venoan culture has highly valued strength, skill and boldness. Venoan community leaders
                typically took and kept control by force of will (and sometimes physical force). This would
                eventually create a rift between them and the Alliance, since the Alliance operated on principles of
                democracy and equity. This disagreement would lead to the Venoan War, a catastrophic interstellar war
                that led to the death of nearly five hundred million people in total. Near the end of the Venoan War,
                the Alliance bombed the now nearly-abandoned Venoa into oblivion, wiping out the remainder of the
                offending Venoan government. Nowadays, many Venoans eschew the culture of their heritage, preferring
                to integrate into whatever society they have found themselves in. However, there are still some
                groups that cling to their old ways and are extremely distrustful of outsiders.
            </p>
            <h3>Politics</h3>
            <p>Even Venoan communities who did not side with Venoa during the war typically now harbor a sense of
                distrust toward the Alliance, as well as the organizations supporting it. This distrust is
                reciprocated by some in the Alliance as well. For this reason, Venoans are underrepresented in
                interstellar politics. Old-school Venoans will sometimes become leaders of asteroid colonies, but on
                the whole, Venoans now prefer to operate within the communities they find themselves in rather than
                try to navigate the hostile environment of large-scale politics.

                        are now much rarer than minor Venoans.</p>
