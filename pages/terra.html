            <h2>A Planet of Diversity</h2>
            <p>The most populous planet in the Everskies galaxy, Terra is set apart by its diversity in ecology and
                culture.</p>
            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>Terra is filled with many different biomes, but on average, it is a lush and somewhat cold planet.
                The poles of the planet are so cold as to be inhospitable to all but the most sturdy Terrans, while
                land close to the equator is warm enough to be comfortable to most non-Terran races (and, in some
                instances, hot enough to be uncomfortable). Terra is mostly covered in ocean, which is used for
                transport and travel, but Terrans themselves are land creatures. Most major settlements on Terra are
                located on the coast of a river or sea.</p>
            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Because Terran culture evolved as a collection of largely separate communities that later integrated,
                Terra does not have a distinct cultural identity like many other planets do. However, most Terrans do
                still esteem a set of common values. For example, Terrans tend to esteem justice and fairness. In
                addition, bravery is considered much more of an essential trait among Terrans than other races.
                Beyond that, a Terran's individual values depends mostly on the subculture in which they were raised.</p>
            <h3>Politics</h3>
            <p>Individual Terran nations hold most of the governmental power on Terra, and the general planetary
                government is rather weak in comparison, as its main power is to maintain relations with other
                planets. Because of this, despite Terra's massive population, its role in interstellar political efforts
                is relatively small. Most of Terra's residents care little for politics that does not affect their or
                their loved one's lives.</p>

                    <p>The most common and varied group of Terran, a mammalian Terran is furred and usually stands
                        from five to six feet tall. Mammalian Terrans are equipped with natural weapons in the form
                        of claws and teeth, are very tolerant of cold climates, and have above-average physical
                        strength. Because Terran society is quite integrated between species, mammalian Terrans have
                        little in the way of a unifying culture.</p>

                <div class="tab-pane" id="menu2">
                    <p>Reptilian Terrans are scaly and, on average, are between five and five and a half feet tall.
                        They prefer the warmer climates of Terra's equator (which, incidentally, is why they are the
                        largest non-Mareinian population on Mareinia). They tend to have a more solitary disposition
                        than other Terran species.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane" id="menu3">
                    <p>Avian Terrans are feathered (though flightless) and are usually four to five feet tall. They
                        can tolerate a wide range of climates, though most are not nearly as cold-tolerant as
                        mammalian Terrans. They are the rarest of the Terran species, though they are still numerous
                        throughout the galaxy.</p>
