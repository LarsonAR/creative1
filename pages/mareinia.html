            <h2>A Planet of Progress</h2>
            <p>Mareinia is the largest and second most populous planet in the Everskies galaxy, and its cultural
                emphasis on science, politics and progress makes it a powerful interstellar influence.</p>
            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>Mareinia is an unusually warm and large planet, but its most notable feature is a vast ocean that
                covers almost the entirety of the planet. While the few small landmasses scattered across the
                planet's surface only support limited ecosystems, the ocean is teeming with activity. Mareinians
                evolved in this vast sea, and so most Mareinian settlements are either underwater or anchored
                floating towns. However, Mareinia's largest cities lie mostly on land, often taking up the entirety of a
                landmass and extending into the shallow waters beyond.</p>
            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>While other races might view Mareinians as callously individualistic, the truth is that individual
                growth and effort is simply a very highly esteemed Mareinian value, since Mareinians see their
                society as shaped by the effort of exceptional individuals. Advanced technology and infrastructure
                allows all Mareinians to live in relative financial and cultural security, so the privileged in
                Mareinian society are instead rewarded with widespread recognition, which is considered a high honor.
                On the whole, Mareinians generally value order, intelligence, and patience.</p>
            <h3>Politics</h3>
            <p>Mareinia is quite involved in interstellar politics due to its cultural views on progress and
                expertise. Because politics is viewed more favorably by Mareinians than by most other cultures,
                Mareinians are disproportionally represented in interstellar politics. This, combined with the fact
                that Mareinia has historically been a very technologically advanced civilization, means Mareinian
                influence pushes interstellar scientific progress to a quick pace. However, because most
                interstellar civilizations (especially asteroid colonies) are incompatible with the Mareinian way of
                life, the society's social values have not made nearly as much of an impact as its technical
                accomplishments.</p>

                    <p>Northern Mareinians are tall, thin individuals. Despite being the less populous of the two
                        Mareinian species, they make up the majority of the upper class on Mareinia due to a
                        complicated cultural history. Northern Mareinians typically act in a very formal manner and
                        are a common sight on space stations but are very rare in asteroid colonies.</p>
                    <p>Both Mareinian species are amphibious, have sharp teeth and claws, and stand from 5 and a half
                        to 6 and a half feet tall.</p>

                    <p>Southern Mareinians are bulkier than their northern relatives and are much more
                        tolerant of Mareinia's cold oceanic depths. They value order and stability in their
                        community and are quick to reject individuals who violate their community's norms. They
                        tend to speak more casually and get along better with other species than northern Mareinians.</p>
